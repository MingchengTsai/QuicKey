# Description

Navigate your hundreds of Chrome tabs by typing just part of a page's title or URL!

 • Press alt-Q (ctrl-Q on macOS)
 • Type a few letters
 • Press enter to switch to the selected tab

To toggle between the two most recently used tabs, quickly press the keyboard shortcut twice. Or navigate the full most-recently-used (MRU) tab list as shown below.

You can customize the shortcut key by right-clicking the QuicKey icon and selecting Options.


★ Search for a tab quickly

Unlike other tab switchers, QuicKey uses a Quicksilver-style search algorithm to rank the results, where contiguous matches at the beginning of words are higher in the list, as are matches against capital letters. So you can type just a few letters to quickly find the right tab.

Tab search keyboard shortcuts:

 • enter: switch to the selected tab
 • ↓ or space: move down the list
 • ↑ or shift-space: move up the list
 • pg dn: page down the list
 • pg up: page up the list
 • end: go to the bottom of the list
 • home: go to the top of the list
 • esc: clear the search or close the menu

If you type more than 25 letters, which should be plenty to find the right tab, QuicKey switches to an exact string search to stay fast.

Recently used tabs get a slight boost in the search results ranking, so getting back to a tab you were just using should require typing fewer letters.


★ Navigate the most recently used tabs

 ➤ NOTE: When first installed, QuicKey
      doesn't know which tabs have been
      recently used, but as you use Chrome,
      it will start adding tabs to the MRU list.

Opening QuicKey displays the list of tabs you've visited, in order of recency. Click a tab to switch to it, or use one of the keyboard shortcuts below to navigate the recently used tab history:

 ➤ To switch to the previously active tab:
    • Quickly double-press the alt-Q or ctrl-Q
       shortcut.

 ➤ To navigate farther back in the MRU list:
    • Press alt-A (ctrl-A on macOS) once to
       switch to the previous tab. The QuicKey
       icon will invert for .75 seconds.
    • Press alt-A while the icon is inverted to
       switch to older tabs, once for each tab.
    • Press alt-shift-A to move to newer tabs.
    • Pause to let the icon revert to normal.
    • Press alt-A again to switch back to the
       tab you initially started on.

 ➤ To pick a recent tab from the MRU list:
    • Press the shortcut but keep holding the
       alt key (ctrl key on macOS).
    • Press W to move down through the
       list of recent tabs.
    • Press shift-W to move up.
    • Release alt to switch to the selected tab.
    • You can also highlight an item with the
       mouse, then release alt to go to that tab.

Which shortcuts to use is up to you. Double-pressing alt-Q is nice because there's just one shortcut and you can switch between the two recent tabs as quickly as you want.

alt-A lets you navigate to even older tabs, though the timing can be a little tricky.

Selecting from the MRU menu provides the closest experience to a typical alt-tab menu, but you need to use a different key to navigate while the menu is open.

You can change the alt-A and alt-shift-A shortcuts by right-clicking the QuicKey icon and selecting Options. Look for the "Switch to previous/next tab" shortcuts.


★ Close and reopen tabs

To close the selected tab, press ctrl-W (cmd-ctrl-W on macOS). For instance, you could type "docg" to match all of your Google Docs URLs and then quickly close those you no longer need.

When you open *QuicKey*, the 25 most recently closed tabs are listed below the recent tabs and shown in a faded state with an X icon. They are also returned when you type a query, though they're scored lower than open tabs.

Click a closed tab to reopen it in its original location and with all of its browsing history intact.


★ Move tabs

You can move tabs to the left or right of the current tab, making it easy to pull tabs from other windows into the current one, or to rearrange tabs without using the mouse.

 • Press ctrl-[ to move the selected tab to the
    left of the current one.
 • Press ctrl-] to move it to the right.

Include shift in the shortcut to also unsuspend the tab while moving it. The ctrl key should be used on both Windows and macOS.


★ Search bookmarks

To find a bookmark, type "/b" in the search box, then a space, and then part of the bookmark's name or URL.

 • Press enter to open it in the current tab.
 • Press ctrl-enter (cmd-enter on macOS)
    to open it in a new tab in the current
    window.
 • Press shift-enter to open it in a new
    window.


★ Search the browser history

To find something in the last 2000 pages of your browser history, type "/h" in the search box, then a space, and then part of the page's name or URL.

The same ctrl-enter (cmd-enter on macOS) and shift-enter shortcuts will open the visited page in a new tab or window.


★ The Great Suspender integration

If you use the handy extension "The Great Suspender", then suspended tabs will look faded in the list, and the original URL is shown (not that long one that you see in the location bar). That means if you search for "chrome" or "extension", you won't simply match all the suspended tabs, which is what happens in other tab search extensions.

Press shift-enter to switch to a tab and unsuspend it in one go. Or shift-click it with the mouse.

Sometimes The Great Suspender seems to forget the page's favicon and just shows its own in the tab. In that case, QuicKey will try to show the correct favicon in its list of tabs.


★ Incognito mode

To switch to incognito tabs as well as normal ones, open Chrome's main menu and then go to More tools > Extensions, scroll down to the QuicKey extension, and check the "Allow in incognito" option.

Tabs in incognito mode display the incognito icon, so you can distinguish a normal tab from an incognito one with the same title.


★ Privacy policy

To function, QuicKey needs access to your open tabs, bookmarks and history. The Chrome permissions dialog says QuicKey can also change your bookmarks and browsing history, but it never will. It can't access the page content at all and doesn't transmit any information other than some anonymized Google Analytics metrics.
