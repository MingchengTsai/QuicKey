# *QuicKey* Privacy Policy

When first installed, *QuicKey* asks for these permissions:

- [*Read and change your browsing history on all signed-in devices*](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/sessions)

    *QuicKey* uses this permission to let you search the titles and URLs of the open tabs, as well as pages from your history. The *"all signed-in devices"* part is there only so that recently closed tabs can be restored with their full history.

- [*Read and change your bookmarks*](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/bookmarks)

    *QuicKey* uses this permission to let you search the titles and URLs of your bookmarked pages. It will never change your bookmarks.

*QuicKey* does not request the *Read and modify all your data on all websites you visit* permission that many extensions require, so it can't read or modify the content of any pages you visit. It doesn't transmit any information other than some anonymized Google Analytics metrics.

The complete *QuicKey* source code is available for inspection on [GitHub](https://github.com/fwextensions/QuicKey).
