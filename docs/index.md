## Installation

*QuicKey* can be installed from the Chrome Web Store.

You can click the <img src="img/icon-38.png" style="height: 19px"> button on the toolbar to open the search box.  But if you're using this extension, you probably prefer keyboard access.  The default shortcut on Windows is <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd> and macOS it's <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd>.  To change these, you can go to *Settings > Extensions*, scroll to the very bottom of the page, and then click *Keyboard Shortcuts*.  There you can select a different shortcut.
