# QuicKey

![QuicKey](img/icon-128.png)

If you like to have lots of tabs open in Chrome, it can quickly become difficult to find the one you want.  Each tab gets very small, so you have to hover over each one to see its name in a tooltip.  And there's no overall Windows menu that would let you more easily pick a tab fro ma list.  

*QuicKey* makes tabs much easier to navigate.  Just use its keyboard shortcut to open it, type a few letters of a tab's name or URL, then press <kbd>enter</kbd>.  You can even search through bookmarks and your browsing history.


## Installation

*QuicKey* can be installed from the Chrome Web Store.  It requires Chrome **vXX** or above.

You can click the <img src="img/icon-38.png" style="height: 19px; vertical-align: text-bottom;"> button on the toolbar to open the search box.  But if you're using this extension, you probably prefer keyboard access.  The default shortcut on Windows is <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd> and macOS it's <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd>.  

To change these, you can go to *Settings > Extensions*, scroll to the very bottom of the page, and then click *Keyboard Shortcuts*.  There you can select a different shortcut.   


## Switching tabs

When you've opened the *QuicKey* search box, either by pressing the keyboard shortcut or clicking its icon, you can type a few letters of the title or URL of the tab you're looking for.  *QuicKey* uses a [Quicksilver]() style matching algorithm, where contiguous matches at the beginning of words are ranked highly, as are matches against capital letters at the beginning of words.  This should let you type just a few letters to find the right tab.
 
The first matched tab is selected by default, so you can just press <kbd>enter</kbd> to switch to it.  Or press the <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> or <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> key to move to other results.  You can also click the desired tab with the mouse.
  
Press <kbd>esc</kbd> to clear what you've typed.  If the search box is empty, then pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> will close it. 
 
If you use the handy extension [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en) (and you almost certainly are if you have hundreds of tabs open), then suspended tabs will have a faded icon in the list.  Pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> will just switch to the suspended tab, but you can press <kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to switch to it and unsuspended it in one go.
