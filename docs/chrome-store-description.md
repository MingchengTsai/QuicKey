Quickly switch tabs or access bookmarks and history with a Quicksilver-style search

★
➤

# Description

Navigate your ocean of Chrome tabs by typing part of the page's title or URL.

 • Press the customizable shortcut:
     • Windows: alt-Q
     • macOS: ctrl-Q
 • Type a few letters
 • Press enter to switch to the selected tab

You can also type "/b" to search bookmarks or "/h" to search your browser history.

Customize the shortcut key in Settings > Extensions > Keyboard Shortcuts.


★ Fast tab switching

QuicKey uses a Quicksilver-style matching algorithm, where contiguous matches at the beginning of words are ranked highly, as are matches against capital letters. So you can type just a few letters to find the right tab.

The best match is selected by default, so you can just press enter to switch to that tab. Or press the up/down arrow keys to move to other results. Or just click one.

Press esc to clear what you've typed. If the search box is empty, then pressing esc will close it.


★ Search bookmarks

To find a bookmark, type "/b", then a space, and then part of the bookmark's name or URL.

 • Press enter to open it in the current tab
 • Press ctrl+enter (cmd+enter on macOS) to open it in a new tab in the current window
 • Press shift+enter to open it in a new window


★ Search the browser history

To find something in the last 200 pages of your browser history, type "/h", then a space, and then part of the page's name or URL.

The same ctrl+enter and shift+enter shortcuts will open the visited page in a new tab or window.


★ The Great Suspender integration

If you use the handy extension "The Great Suspender", then suspended tabs will have a faded icon in the list, and the original URL is shown (not that long one that you see in the location bar).

Press shift+enter to switch to a tab and unsuspend it in one go. Or shift-click it with the mouse.


★ Privacy

To function, QuicKey needs access to your open tabs, bookmarks and history. The permissions dialog says QuicKey can also change your bookmarks and browsing history, but it never will. It also doesn't interact with the page content in any way and doesn't transmit any information anywhere.
