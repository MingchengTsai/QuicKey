# Description

Navigate your ocean of Chrome tabs by typing just a few letters of of the page's title or URL. 
 
 • Press the customizable shortcut:
     • Windows: alt-Q 
     • macOS: ctrl-Q 
 • Type a few letters
 • Press enter to switch to the selected tab     

Type "/b" to search bookmarks or "/h" to search your browser history. 

Customize the shortcut key in Settings > Extensions > Keyboard Shortcuts.  


SWITCHING TABS

When you've opened the QuicKey search box, type a few letters of the title or URL of the tab you're looking for. QuicKey uses a Quicksilver-style matching algorithm, where contiguous matches at the beginning of words are ranked highly, as are matches against capital letters at the beginning of words. This approach should let you type just a few letters to find the right tab.
 
The first matched tab is selected by default, so you can just press enter to switch to it. Or press the up or down arrow keys to move to other results. You can also click the desired tab using the mouse.
 
Press esc to clear what you've typed. If the search box is empty, then pressing esc will close it. 

If you use the handy extension The Great Suspender (and you almost certainly are if you have hundreds of tabs open), then suspended tabs will have a faded icon in the list, and the original URL is shown, not that long one that you see in the location bar. Pressing enter will switch to the suspended tab, but you can press shift+enter to switch to the tab and unsuspend it in one go. 


SEARCHING BOOKMARKS AND HISTORY

Besides tabs, you can also quickly open bookmarks or pages from your browser history using QuicKey. To search all of your bookmarks, type "/b", then a space, and then start typing part of the name or URL of a bookmark. 
  
When you've selected the desired bookmark, press enter to open it in the current tab. Press ctrl+enter (cmd+enter on macOS) to open the bookmark in a new tab in the current window, or press shift+enter to open the bookmark in a new window.  

To match a page from your history, type "/h", then a space, and then start typing part of the name or URL of a page. The same ctrl+enter and shift+enter shortcuts work with visited pages to open them in new tabs or windows. The last 200 pages in the history are available for searching through QuicKey.

 
PRIVACY

To function, QuicKey needs access to your open tabs, bookmarks and history. It doesn't interact with the page content in any way and doesn't transmit any information anywhere.
